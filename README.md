A full-featured i18n management suite for VS Code. Real-time validation, inline translations, key table, hover across locales, CodeLens, sort keys, and plain-text detection. Supports ngx-translate and similar setups.

Supports two file structures:

- **Namespaced:** `src/assets/i18n/{locale}/{namespace}.json`
- **Flat:** `src/assets/i18n/{locale}.json` (e.g. `en.json`, `es.json` — auto-detected)

**Version: 2.3.5**

## Features

### Real-time Validation

Detects all i18n keys used in HTML templates and TypeScript files, and keeps them flagged until they are **100% translated across every locale**:

- **Missing key** — the key does not exist in the source locale. Quick Fix: _Crear key en todos los locales_.
- **Incomplete key** — the key exists in the source but is **missing or empty** in one or more other locales. The diagnostic lists exactly which locales are missing (e.g. _missing/empty in: en, fr_) and stays visible until every locale has a non-empty value. Quick Fix: _Completar traducciones_ opens the sidebar form prefilled with the existing translations and focus on the first missing locale.

**Parent-object lookups are supported.** Fetching a whole sub-tree at once — e.g. `translate.instant('reservation.dateFormat')` where `dateFormat` is an object of nested keys — is a valid ngx-translate pattern and is **not** flagged as missing. The validator recognizes both leaf keys and parent-object paths; a parent lookup is only flagged when the sub-tree is absent in some locale.

The marker only disappears once the key is present and non-empty in **all** locales. Automatically updates when locale JSON files are edited.

### Inline Decorations

Shows the translation text in **gray italic** next to each key, directly in the editor. Always visible without hovering. Updates when switching tabs or modifying JSON files.

### Smart Hover — HTML & TypeScript

Hover over any i18n key to see its translations across all available locales. Fixed order: **ES first, EN second**, rest alphabetical. Each locale includes a link that opens the JSON file at the exact key line, and an **✎ Abrir en formulario** button that opens the sidebar form loaded with that key and all its translations.

### Hover in Locale JSON files

When editing a `.json` locale file, hover over any key to see its translations in **all other languages**. Each entry shows a direct link to open that locale at the exact key line, plus an **✎ Abrir en formulario** button to edit all translations from the sidebar. Works for both flat and namespaced structures.

### Quick Fix — Create key in all locales

When a key is marked as missing, the VS Code 💡 lightbulb appears. The action writes the missing key to **all locale JSON files simultaneously**. Prompts for the source locale value; other locales get a `[LOCALE] value` placeholder.

### Ctrl+Click — Go to Source (HTML / TS)

`Ctrl+Click` on any i18n key in an HTML template or TypeScript file opens the source locale JSON at the exact line where the key is defined.

### Autocompletion (IntelliSense)

Suggests all available keys from the source locale when typing inside a `| translate` or `translate.instant()` context. Shows the translation as detail in the suggestion menu. Works in HTML templates and TypeScript files.

### i18n Key Table — full overview

Opens a **table panel** showing all keys as rows and each locale as a column. Features:

- Filter by key name or translation value in real time
- Toggle **Solo faltantes** to see only keys missing in at least one locale
- Click `↗` on any cell to jump directly to that key in the locale JSON file
- Missing cells show a **✚ crear** button that opens the sidebar **Add i18n Key** form, prefilled with the key, any existing translations, and focus on the missing locale
- Button **⟳ Refrescar** to reload keys from disk — use it when a JSON file was edited outside the extension and the table did not pick up the change
- Button **⇅ Ordenar A→Z** to sort all locale files alphabetically (with confirmation)
- An in-panel toast confirms the result of sort and refresh actions
- Table auto-refreshes when keys are created or locale JSON files change

### i18n Table for current file — toolbar button

A **🌐 globe icon** appears in the editor toolbar when viewing an `.html` or `.ts` file. Clicking it opens the table **filtered to the keys used in that file only**. Below the table, a **💡 Textos sin traducir** section detects plain text in the HTML (tag content, `placeholder`, `title`, `aria-label` attributes) that has no `| translate` — each shows a **+ crear key** button.

### Add i18n Key — sidebar form

The **✚ Add i18n Key** section in the sidebar is a full form to create **or edit** a key across all locales:

- **Key field** — dot-notation (e.g. `common.save`). **Locked (read-only) by default** with a 🔒 / ✏️ toggle; click it to rename the key when you really need to. This prevents accidental edits when you opened the form just to complete translations.
- **Per-locale inputs** — one input per detected locale, each labeled with a flag emoji. Existing translations are pre-filled when editing.
- **⚡ Translate** — auto-translates that locale from the source locale using the MyMemory API (no API key required).
- **⚡ Translate All** — translates every non-source locale from the **source locale (`es` by default)** and shows a **before → after diff panel**. Nothing is applied until you press **✓ Confirmar todo**; **✕ Cancelar** discards the proposal so your current values stay untouched.
- **✓ Create Key** — writes the key to all locale JSON files simultaneously (upsert — also used to save edits).

The form opens pre-filled from three places: a plain-text suggestion chip (key + source value), the ✚ crear button on a missing table cell (key + existing translations, focus on the missing locale), and the ✎ _Abrir en formulario_ button in any key hover.

### CodeLens in locale JSON files

On the first line of any locale JSON file, two CodeLens actions appear:

- **`$(table) Ver tabla i18n`** — opens the full key table
- **`$(sort-precedence) Ordenar keys A→Z`** — sorts keys alphabetically with a confirmation dialog

The sort confirmation asks whether to sort **only this file** or **all locale files**. If all files are selected, a second modal lists every file that will be rewritten before proceeding.

> 📸 _Screenshot: sort confirmation modal asking "Solo este archivo" vs "Todos los locales"_ — proximamente

### Locale navigation from JSON — jump between languages

While editing a locale JSON file you can walk the **same key** across every language without leaving the editor:

- **`Ctrl+Click`** on a key jumps to that same key in the **next locale that has it**, cycling through all locales and wrapping from the last back to the first. Locales where the key is missing are skipped, and the cursor lands just inside the value string ready to edit.
- Navigation uses VS Code's native _Go to Definition_, so it fires **only on the actual click** — holding Ctrl and moving the pointer just shows a peek preview and never navigates or changes files.
- **Scroll position is preserved:** the target key opens at the **same on-screen position** the clicked key had, so cycling through locales doesn't jump the viewport around.

Locale order follows the same convention as everywhere else: **ES first, EN second**, the rest alphabetical. There are no per-line CodeLenses, so the text never shifts as the cursor moves.

| Pattern               | Example                                       |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Pipe in template      | `'company.tabs.menu' \| translate`            |
| Binding with pipe     | `[attr]="'company.title' \| translate"`       |
| Ternary with pipe     | `(cond ? 'key.one' : 'key.two') \| translate` |
| `translate.instant()` | `this.translate.instant('errors.notFound')`   |
| `translate.get()`     | `this.translate.get('auth.login')`            |
| `translate.stream()`  | `this.translate.stream('profile.title')`      |

---

## File Structure

The extension automatically detects the pattern used — no additional configuration required.

### Namespaced (one file per feature)

```
src/assets/i18n/
├── es/
│   ├── company.json
│   └── reservation.json
├── en/
│   ├── company.json
│   └── reservation.json
└── fr/
    ├── company.json
    └── reservation.json
```

Each file has **a single root namespace**:

```json
{
  "company": {
    "tabs": {
      "menu": "Menu",
      "services": "Services"
    }
  }
}
```

### Flat (one file per locale)

```
src/assets/i18n/
├── es.json
├── en.json
└── fr.json
```

---

## Configuration

Add this to your project's `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "i18nKV.localesPath": "src/assets/i18n",
  "i18nKV.sourceLocale": "es",
  "i18nKV.severity": "info"
}
```

| Setting               | Type                                 | Default             | Description                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `i18nKV.localesPath`  | string                               | `"src/assets/i18n"` | Path to the locales folder (relative to workspace root) |
| `i18nKV.sourceLocale` | string                               | `"es"`              | Source locale used to validate keys                     |
| `i18nKV.severity`     | `"error"` \| `"warning"` \| `"info"` | `"info"`            | Diagnostic severity for missing i18n keys               |

| `i18n Studio Pro: Show i18n Table for this file`     | Opens the table filtered to the keys of the active file          |
| `i18n Studio Pro: Sort locale file keys A→Z`         | Sorts keys of a locale file alphabetically (with confirmation)   |
| `i18n Studio Pro: Sort ALL locale files keys A→Z`    | Sorts keys of all locale files alphabetically (with confirmation)|

Access from the command palette: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → `i18n Studio Pro: ...`

The **🌐 button** in the editor toolbar (visible on `.html` and `.ts` files) is a shortcut to `Show i18n Table for this file`.

## How it works

1. On activation, auto-detects file structure (namespaced vs flat)
2. Reads all locales and flattens nested keys into dot-notation (`company.tabs.menu`)
3. Scans each open `.html` and `.ts` file for `| translate` and `translate.instant/get/stream()` patterns
4. Marks as error/warning/info any key not found in the source locale
5. Shows inline decorations with the translation in gray italic next to each key
6. `Ctrl+Click` in HTML/TS navigates to the source locale JSON at the exact key line; in a locale JSON, it cycles to the next locale that has the key (skipping missing ones), on the click only
7. Watches locale JSON files for changes and re-validates automatically

---

## Manual Installation

1. Download the `.vsix` file
2. In VS Code: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → **Extensions: Install from VSIX...**
3. Select the `.vsix` file
4. Reload VS Code
